**Version 1.1.2 is out**. Version 1.1.2 is only a maintenance release. There are no new features and no bug fixes, but a few new box designs and several changes to the way that *boxes* is built. So version 1.1.2 should be easier to build on more platforms. <!--break-->

  - Several changes to URL references and comments which were prompted by the move to GitHub
  - Added low-tech test suite so that we can now write [test cases]({{ site.baseurl}}/testing.html) for *boxes*
  - Patch by *Salvatore Bonaccorso* to fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd
  - Patch by *Jakub Hrozek* to eliminate a compilation warning on Fedora
  - Patch to make compilation on MacOS easier by *Mike Meyer*
  - Added boxes-pkg.openwrt by *Lu Weifeng* to build and package boxes on OpenWrt
  - Consolidated separated Makefiles for Unix and Win32 into one for easier [Windows build](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/wiki/Windows-Build)
  
  - New unicorn box designs by *Mike Meyer*
  - New box design 'caml' by *Michael Tiernan*

The detailed changes can be seen in the [commit history](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/commits/master).

This release also includes all pre-GitHub changes that the author is aware of. All future changes will be through GitHub.

Binaries welcome!
