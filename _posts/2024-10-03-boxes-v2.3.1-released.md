Provides a bug fix for some older Windows variants.<!--break-->

- Some older forms of Windows may not properly process ANSI color codes in the terminal. For those cases, we provide
  a fix.  
  Make sure to tell your Windows to support UTF-8, too
  ([how]({% post_url 2024-03-13-windows-unicode-config %})). That's generally a good config on
  Windows, not just for *boxes*.
- The debug logs can now be displayed via `-x debug` on all platforms
  ([details]({{ site.baseurl}}/contributing.html#debug-output)). No need to recompile everything with
  preprocessor macros anymore.
