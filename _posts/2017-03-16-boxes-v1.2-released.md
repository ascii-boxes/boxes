**Version 1.2 is out**. This release features a minor enhancement to the configuration file capabilities,
several bug fixes, improvements to the build, and several new box designs.<!--break-->

- The *boxes* configuration file knows a new keyword: `designer`. This gives us the possibility to
  distinguish between the person who created the original ASCII art, and the person who made it into
  a *boxes* configuration. Despite this change, the *boxes* config files remain compatible in both directions.
- Patch by [Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Coudert](https://github.com/fxcoudert) to enable *boxes* to be compiled
  as a 64-bit application on Mac. *Boxes* is available on MacOS via Homebrew.
- Patch by [Yu-Jie Lin](https://github.com/livibetter) to better close file handles
- Bug fix by [Nic H](https://github.com/scyptnex) on OSX where a box size description like `x7` was
  being interpreted as hexadecimal&nbsp;7
- Two fixes to the [*boxes* mode for Emacs]({{ site.baseurl}}/docs/install.html#emacs) by
  [Jason L. Shiffer](https://github.com/zerotao) in response to bug reports, one fix suggested by
  *Kevin Ryde*
- Bug fix by [Salvatore Bonaccorso](https://github.com/carnil) which had caused the build to fail on
  Ubuntu

- New box designs 'tex-cmt' and 'tex-box' by [Nic H](https://github.com/scyptnex)
- New box design 'face' by [bdimych](https://github.com/bdimych)
- New box designs 'twisted' and 'scroll-akn' by [Tristano Ajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)
