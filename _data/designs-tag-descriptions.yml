            <strong>Note:</strong> In order to color the text, <i>boxes</i> will output ANSI escape codes. Usually,
            your terminal will interpret them properly. However, many text editors cannot do that, and you may see
            gibberish. In that case, consider using a different design or the <code>--no-color</code> option.
        </div>
