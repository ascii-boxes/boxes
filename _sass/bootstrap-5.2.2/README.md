# bootstrap

This folder contains the unmodified SCSS files of the bootstrap framework (under MIT license).

Get updates from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/

- Download the *sources*, then copy the `scss/` folder's contents here.

The version number of these files should match the version number of bootstrap itself we are using, and also of
bootswatch-litera (the theme).
