# Boxes Website

The `gh-pages` branch is home to the [*boxes* website](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com).

It is based on GitHub's native [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and a few
[open-source components](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/website-attribution.html).

In case you want to run the website on your local machine, for instance in order to test some changes,
[here](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/2021/05/website-updates.html#website-on-local-machine) is how to do that.
