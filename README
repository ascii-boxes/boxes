GETTING IT

    http://boxes.thomasjensen.com/

    Boxes is free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL),
    version 2. See COPYING file or http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.


COMPILING IT

    Skip this section if you got yourself a binary distribution. NOTE,
    however, that the location of the system-wide config file can only be
    changed using the source distribution, because its path is compiled in.

    1. Unpack the archive

    2. Edit the top level Makefile and change the value of GLOBALCONF to
       whereever you want the system-wide config file to reside. Note that
       each user may have his/her own config file in $HOME/.boxes.
       Also note that the value of GLOBALCONF is a full file name. It does
       NOT specify a directory into which to copy the config file.

    3. If you are on DEC/OSF, edit src/regexp/Makefile, and add
       -D_ANSI_C_SOURCE to the CFLAGS definition.

    4. Type 'make' in the top level directory.
       This should leave you with a binary in the src directory.

    The boxes development platform is intel/linux (SLES). If you are on a
    different platform and somehow manage to materialize a binary, please
    send it to the author (boxes@thomasjensen.com), so it can be posted on
    the boxes home page. Boxes is generally very easy to port, because it
    uses only a small set of instructions and is comformant to the ANSI C
    standard.

    For a small collection of frequently asked questions, visit the
    compilation FAQ on the boxes website.


INSTALLING IT

    1. If you are installing a BINARY distribution:

            - Copy boxes.1 to an appropriate manual page directory
            - Copy boxes-config to /usr/share/boxes
              Note that /usr/share/boxes is the name of the file,
              and NOT the name of a directory into which to copy the file.
              So, the name of the config file is changed from boxes-config
              to just boxes.
            - Copy the executable to a location which is in your path

        Example (as root):

            cp boxes.1 /usr/share/man/man1
            cp boxes-config /usr/share/boxes
            cp boxes /usr/bin


       If you are installing a SOURCE distribution:
       
            - Copy doc/boxes.1 to an appropriate manual page directory
            - Copy boxes-config to the location specified in the Makefile
              as being the name of the system-wide boxes config file.
              Note that the value of GLOBALCONF is the name of the file,
              and NOT the name of a directory into which to copy the file.
              So, the name of the config file is changed from boxes-config
              to just boxes.
            - Copy src/boxes (the binary) to a location which is in your
              path

       Example (as root):

            cp doc/boxes.1 /usr/share/man/man1
            cp boxes-config /usr/share/boxes
            cp src/boxes /usr/bin

    2. If you want to make your own changes to the config file, copy the
       system-wide config file into your home as $HOME/.boxes, then modify
       it. Boxes will use $HOME/.boxes if it exists.

    3. Installation into your text editor: Please see the installation page
       on the Web at http://boxes.thomasjensen.com/docs/install.shtml
       It currently describes installation with vim, emacs, and jed, but
       this list may grow as time goes by and people send me how-tos.


RUNNING IT

    Try if boxes works by typing "boxes" on the command line, then enter
    "foo", press return and hit Ctrl-D. It should give you something
    like that:  /*******/
                /* foo */
                /*******/

    Detailed usage information is in the manual page and a lot more can be
    found on the Web page (see above). It is especially interesting to tie
    boxes to your editor, so that it can be invoked by a simple keypress.


DEFINING YOUR OWN BOXES

    Any user may define his own box designs by creating a file called
    .boxes in his home directory. The syntax of the config file is
    explained on the boxes home page, along with several examples:

CONTACT

    * For questions which the online documentation could not answer,
      requests for more features, praise and bug reports please feel free
      to email the author at boxes@thomasjensen.com. Bug reports are
      especially appreciated.

    * For questions particular to the binary you downloaded contact the
      supplier of the binary listed on the download page.

    * Send your cool new box designs to boxes@thomasjensen.com! If I like
      them, they may be added to the official config file.
