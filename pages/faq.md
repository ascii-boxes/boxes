# FAQ

These are the frequently asked questions about the *boxes* program and their answers.

These questions are *actually* "frequently asked". For general information on the *boxes* program, installation
instructions, and information on box design creation please refer to the
[*boxes* documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/).

   text="Q. 1. What is a text filter program?" %}

There is a [separate page]({{ site.baseurl }}/filters.html) explaining this. *Boxes* is mostly used as such a
filter program.

   text="Q. 2. Error message \"input in flex scanner failed\"" %}

Upgrade to version 1.0.1 or later. Versions prior to 1.0.1 gave this error message when the config file they were
trying to read was in fact a directory. The global config file name is */usr/share/boxes* on most systems. This is the
name of the file, not the name of a directory into which a config file would be placed.

   text="Q. 3. Boxes destroys my tabs!" %}

By default, all tab characters are replaced by spaces. However, you can change this behavior using the `-t` option
(since version 1.1). The `-t` option only affects leading tabs. Tabs which end up inside the box are *always* converted
into spaces.  
Note that you can also set the tab stop distance (== how many spaces per tab) using the `-t` option.

   text="Q. 4. \"Can't read file C:\TEMP\VIO44.TMP\" when calling boxes from vim" %}

On Windows, this error message may appear instead of a box when *boxes* is called from vim. This is not a problem of
*boxes*. In fact, it's a misleading message from the vim editor which is supposed to tell you that *boxes* is not in
your PATH. Solution: Copy *boxes.exe* and *boxes.cfg* to a directory which is in your PATH. (thanks *Jeff Lanzarotta*,

   text="Q. 5. Compilation" %}

Detailed information on how to build *boxes* from source is collected on the
[build page]({{ site.baseurl }}/build.html).

In addition to that, the following issues have occurred:

- Custom library locations\\
  If you have manually provided some of the libraries that *boxes* uses for building, such as pcre2 or libunistring,
  you may need to tell our build where to find them. For this, use the `CFLAGS_ADDTL` and `LDFLAGS_ADDTL`
  environment variables. They can be used to add options to the compiler and linker calls. For example:

      make CFLAGS_ADDTL=-I/Users/USER/local/include LDFLAGS_ADDTL=-L/Users/USER/local/lib

- `Bad address` on *boxes* execution after compiling on a 64bit system:
  This may happen when the system you are compiling on is 64bit. Boxes is only a 32bit program, so the compiler may
  have to be forced to 32bit by adding the `-m32` option. (Thanks to
  <span class="atmention">[@stefanow](https://github.com/stefanow)</span> for
  [supplying](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/issues/7){:target="_blank"} this information!)
  In order to do this, use the following command line (works with current sources):

      make CFLAGS_ADDTL=-m32 LDFLAGS_ADDTL=-m32

- Compilation on SLES:\\
  On SLES, you might need to add `-std=c99` as observed by
  <span class="atmention">[@mathomp4](https://github.com/mathomp4)</span> in
  [#74](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/74#issuecomment-784371446).

   text="Q. 6. Character Encoding" %}

Since v2.0.0, *boxes* supports different character encodings for input/output text. The config file, however, is
still ASCII (we are working on that). *boxes* normally picks up your system encoding, which on most systems, is simply
UTF-8. You can override this behavior with `-n`. *boxes* shows what it thinks is the system encoding when you call
`boxes -h` - the displayed default value for `-n` is the system encoding.

   text="Q. 7. How to align a box within a terminal window?" %}

The *boxes* options only allow aligning the text within a box, but it is actually possible to use *boxes* to align the
entire box within a terminal window. At least on Unix / Linux ... we don't currently know how to do this on Windows.

This method assumes that `tput cols` yields the width of the terminal window. If it doesn't, you'd have to find another
way to get this information, for example a `$COLUMNS` environment variable.

Centered:

```shell
echo -e foo\\ncenter | boxes -d parchment -p h5 | boxes -s $(tput cols) -c x -a hc -i none | cut -c 2-
```

Right-aligned:

```shell
echo -e foo\\nright-aligned | boxes -d parchment -p h5 | boxes -s $(tput cols) -c x -a hr -i none | sed -e 's/^x/ /'
```

Note that we `-a hc` instead of just `-ac`, because we want to align the whole block of text, not individual lines.  
The result looks like this:

   text="Q. 8. Can you rewrite this in X?" %}

Short answer: No.

Long answer: I know, *boxes* is written in C, which was a perfectly reasonable choice given that it was made in the
1990s. A lot of software was written in C at the time. It was one of the most portable ways of writing software. And
it requires no runtime like Java or Python would. Today (2024), we have Go, and Rust, and other comparatively new
languages available that would be a great fit for *boxes* and offer far superior developer experience. So why not
rewrite *boxes* in one of those?

As Joel Spolsky explains in his epic blog post
["Things You Should Never Do, Part I"](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/),
rewriting a codebase is most likely a horrible mistake, and generally a project that is likely to fail. Even if it
wasn't really a rewrite, but rather we take the C code and cross-compile it to something else, that would at best
double our maintenance effort. I've been maintaining *boxes* for over 25 years now, and you can imagine that my life
is very different now than it was then. *boxes* is kept going on a very slim time budget. I need to be careful and
choose my battles wisely. That doesn't mean large efforts are totally out of the question, as we see with Unicode
and color support which was eventually added. But it took many years to do that. A rewrite, or even just a major
increase in support effort, is just not possible.

So it comes down to effort for me. On the upside, that means that if *you* were to contribute a reimplementation
of *boxes* in another language, and that implementation passed the
[end-to-end test suite]({{ site.baseurl}}/testing.html#black-box-tests), then that's great! If you'd be willing to
do all the maintenance, I would host it under the [ascii-boxes](https://github.com/ascii-boxes) group on GitHub!
