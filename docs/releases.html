## When to upgrade

Boxes has been around a long time, and it has been very stable. Sometimes, new releases are still
required to ensure that *boxes* continues to compile smoothly on a large number of platforms.
Whether or not you should upgrade to a new version depends on what you've got, and what you want
to do:

- **Building from Source:** If you want to [build from source]({{ site.baseurl}}/build.html), you
  should always use the latest sources from the above table. You may also clone the repo and build
  the bleeding edge. Since we have a stable master branch, this will also get you a good build, but
  it will be a snapshot version.

- **Using a binary:** The last major functional enhancements were in version 1.1 (of 2006). So if
  you've got a working 1.1 binary on your system, you're good and you don't really need to upgrade.
  Staying on the even older 1.0.1 will mean that you're missing features (such as better tab
  handling and the 'mend' option). Anything prior to 1.0.1 should definitely be upgraded.

Note that you can always copy the [latest box designs](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/blob/master/boxes-config)
from GitHub to replace your older *boxes-config* (Unix) or *boxes.cfg* (Windows) - the designs
are backwards compatible.
