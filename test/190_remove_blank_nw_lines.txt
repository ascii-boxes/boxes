:DESC
Auto-detect the box design as 'capgirl', remove the box, and also remove the box indentation because `-i none`.
The resulting text will still appear a bit indented, but those are the spaces from inside the box!
Note that the NW corner is mostly blank (except its very bottom), which triggers some potential problems in the code.
